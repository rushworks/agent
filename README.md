# @rushworks/agent

The official RushworksAI agent runtime. Wraps Claude (and other model
providers as we add them) so you can hire it into your Rushworks org as a
first-class teammate without writing the connection plumbing yourself.

It is the default BYOA implementation — but BYOA is not the only path. If
you have a more sophisticated agent setup (Claude Code with a custom
SKILL, your own framework, etc.), you can still connect via the documented
`/api/agent/*` REST API and ignore this CLI.

## What it does

- Authenticates to your Rushworks portal with the bearer token you got
  when an org owner added you in the **Agents** tab.
- Holds a Socket.IO connection open to the portal so it reacts to task
  assignments and `needs_input` resolutions in real time.
- Falls back to a periodic catchup poll if the WebSocket drops.
- When a task is assigned (or already In Progress on restart), it spins
  up a tool-use loop: reads the task, fetches the project briefing,
  loads `CLAUDE.md` + your shared Claude Code memory from the working
  directory, and works the task with role-appropriate tools.
- Posts a comment with its summary, then moves the task to **Ready** for
  human acceptance. (It is never allowed to mark a task **Completed** —
  that is the human acceptance moment.)

## Install

One-liner that detects your OS, clones the repo, installs deps, and walks you through workspace setup:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rushworks/agent/main/install.sh | sh
```

By default this installs the agent under `~/rushworks/agent-cli/` and scaffolds the first workspace at `~/rushworks/agents/<name>/`. Re-run the same command to add more agents on the same host (the script detects an existing install and skips re-cloning).

Prerequisites: Node 20+, git, and a shell (`sh`-compatible). The script refuses cleanly on unsupported platforms (Windows native — use WSL or `npm install` from a clone).

If you'd rather install from source by hand:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rushworks/agent.git ~/rushworks/agent-cli
cd ~/rushworks/agent-cli && npm install
node bin/rushworks-agent init --workspace ~/rushworks/agents/my-agent
```

## Setup

After install, the script will have already run `init --workspace` for you. To rerun setup or scaffold an additional workspace:

```bash
node ~/rushworks/agent-cli/bin/rushworks-agent init --workspace ~/rushworks/agents/another-agent
```

Walks you through:

- **Portal URL** — where your Rushworks portal lives. For local dev this
  is usually `http://<your-LAN-IP>:8081`. Avoid `localhost` — agents on
  another machine can't reach `localhost` back to yours.
- **Agent token** — the `rwsk_...` value shown once when an org owner
  hired you in the portal. If you lost it, re-issue it from the agent's
  page.
- **Provider + model** — defaults to Anthropic / `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
- **Anthropic API key** — your own key. You hold the model contract
  (that's the "B" in BYOA).
- **Working directory** — absolute path to the repo you'll work in. Only
  needed for **developer**-role agents; analysts can run without one.

Config is written to `~/.rushworks/agent.json` with `0600` permissions.

## Run

```bash
rushworks-agent start
```

What you'll see on a clean boot:

```
[agent] portal=https://your-portal-host  model=claude-sonnet-4-6  wd=/Users/me/repo
[agent] starting agent
[agent] hello, codey (id=2, role=developer)
[agent] skill loaded (4827 chars)
[agent] LLM ready: anthropic / claude-sonnet-4-6
[agent] loaded 19 tools for role=developer: portal_list_tasks, ...
[agent] realtime connected (sid=...)
[agent] realtime subscribed to projects: [1]
[agent] agent ready — waiting for events
```

Stop with `Ctrl-C`. The agent will exit cleanly; in-progress task state
is left on the portal so the next process picks up where you left off.

## Useful commands

```bash
rushworks-agent whoami   # verify the configured token + show identity
rushworks-agent start    # the main loop
rushworks-agent init     # rerun setup (existing answers are pre-filled)
```

## Environment-variable overrides

Any setting in the config file can be overridden by env var. Useful for
CI runs and ephemeral `npx` invocations.

| Env var                 | Overrides                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| `RW_PORTAL_URL`         | `portal_url`               |
| `RW_AGENT_TOKEN`        | `agent_token`              |
| `RW_PROVIDER`           | `provider`                 |
| `RW_MODEL`              | `model`                    |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`     | `anthropic_api_key`        |
| `RW_WORKING_DIRECTORY`  | `working_directory`        |
| `RW_MAX_TOKENS`         | `max_tokens`               |
| `RW_POLL_INTERVAL`      | `poll_interval_seconds`    |
| `RW_MAX_CONCURRENT`     | `max_concurrent_tasks`     |
| `RW_MAX_ITERATIONS`     | `max_iterations_per_task`  |
| `DEBUG`                 | enables verbose logging    |

## Roles & tools

The server tells the agent its role on `/api/agent/whoami`. The runtime
loads only the tools that role is allowed to use.

| Tool prefix | Analyst | Developer |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| `portal_*`  | ✓       | ✓         |
| `system_list_dir`, `system_read_file`, `system_glob`, `system_grep` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `system_write_file`, `system_edit_file`, `system_bash` | ✗ | ✓ |
| `github_*`  | ✗       | ✓         |

The portal *also* enforces this on every request, so even a hand-crafted
HTTP call from an analyst will get a 403 trying to mint a git token or
open a PR.

## How it stays in sync

- **Primary**: a Socket.IO connection to the portal. On boot the agent
  auto-joins every `project:<id>` room it's a member of, plus its
  personal `agent:<id>` room. It receives `task:event`, `message:event`,
  and `notification:event` pushes.
- **Fallback**: a polling loop every `poll_interval_seconds` (default 30)
  that calls `GET /api/agent/tasks?status=Queued`. Catches anything the
  WS missed during a disconnect.
- **Boot catchup**: on start, the agent reads all of its `In Progress`
  tasks (in case it died mid-task last run) and works them first.

## Filesystem perimeter

The agent's filesystem tools refuse to read or write outside its
`working_directory`. This is the agent's own sandbox — the portal can't
reach files outside it, and the agent can't reach files outside it
either. Set `working_directory` to the specific repo or workspace you
trust the agent to touch.

`system_bash` runs with the same boundary: `cwd = working_directory`. It
still has the *user's* shell privileges (no sandboxing beyond cwd), so
treat the working directory as the trust line.

## Troubleshooting

- **`Token verification failed: HTTP 401`** — token is wrong or revoked.
  Re-issue from the agent's portal page and rerun `init`.
- **`Token verification failed: fetch failed`** — portal URL is wrong or
  the portal isn't running. Confirm the URL is reachable with
  `curl $RW_PORTAL_URL/api/agent/whoami` (which should 401).
- **`no tools available — check role + tools/index.js`** — your role on
  the portal doesn't grant any tools. Has someone changed your agent's
  role to something unexpected?
- **`no working_directory configured`** when a developer-role tool tries
  to run — rerun `init` and supply an absolute path.
